## Purpose:
### In this challenge we are finishing our partially completed dashboard like completed panel for demographic information and  visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer. Specifically, our volunteers should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, our volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.The purpose of this research is to gather, identify and analyze the biological footprint of individualsâ€™ navels.
