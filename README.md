## Purpose:
### In this challenge, we are finishing our partially completed dashboard for demographic information and  visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer. Specifically, our volunteers should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, our volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.The purpose of this research is to gather, identify and analyze the biological footprint of individuals’ navels.
## Result :
### Belly Button Biodiversity Interactive Dashboard we can see by using following link:

### You can see our website image also:

### Volunteers can find one’s information by selecting unique ID from a drop-down menu and explore data by deep dive in their own results or compare the results to other . This research is also public and easily accessible, so anyone can learn more about belly button biodiversity and explore this fascinating field.
### Graph makes it is easy to understand and compare result for example in images we can see the diffrence between studntID 940 and studentID 959:

## Summery: The belly button is one of the habitats closest to us, and yet it remains relatively unexplored. Launched Belly Button Biodiversity to investigate the microbes inhabiting our navels try to convey data to our volunteers and other researchers. For volunteers who are interested in selling their bacteria to Improbable Beef, they visualize the types of bacteria that colonize their bellies.Some of them will be suitable for synthetic beef production, while others will not.
